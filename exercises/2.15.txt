She is right because each use of an uncertain number brings a certain amount
of error into the result.  This is due to the nature of intervals, in that
we are not dealing with exact values. Instead they have tolerances of error
that we must take into account when performing arithmetic on them. The more
operations on the unknown quantities, the higher our tolerance must be.
