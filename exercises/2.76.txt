; Describe the changes that must be made to a system in order to add 
; new types or new operations.

generic operation with explicit dispatch:
   The new types and the procedures that operate on them must be added 
to the system. Their names must also not conflict with any other procedures
already defined.
All client facing procedures must be updated to be aware of the new types.

data-directed style:
   The new types and the procedures that operate on them must be added
to the dispatch table and constructors provided for tagged data of this new
type.

message-passing style:
   A new 'object' must be added that dispatches appropriately for the new
data type to the correct procedure for the new type.

The message-passing style would be most appropriate for a system in
 which new types must often be added. This is due to the fact that one must
only provide the new 'object' and the procedures to operate on them, and no
other code is changed.

In a situation where new operations are added often, either data-directed 
style or message-passing style would both be appropriate because they both
require adding the new procedures (to the installation procedure for 
data-directed, and the objects themselves for message-passing), and updating
 either the dispatch table or the objects that know about the new operations.
So they result in about the same amount of changes to the system.
