;; Define procedures that implement the term-list representation
;; described above as appropriate for dense polynomials.

;; The description on page 276:
;; The term lists of dense polynomials are most efficiently represented as
;; lists of the coefficients. For example, A above would be nicely
;; represented as (1 2 0 3 -2 -5). The order of a term in this representation
;; is the length of the sublist beginning with that termâ€™s coefficient,
;; decremented by 1.

;; List of term-list procedures from page 277.

;; The only differing functions are adjoin term and first-term
;; which deal with the term-list just being a list of coefficients
;; and the order being the index of that term in the list.
