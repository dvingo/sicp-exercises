# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs solutions

This is a repository containing notes and my progress of solutions to the exercises from the (in)famous text.

The book can be found here: [http://sicpebook.wordpress.com/](http://sicpebook.wordpress.com/)

All exercises were run against the MIT/GNU [Scheme](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/scheme/) interpreter.
